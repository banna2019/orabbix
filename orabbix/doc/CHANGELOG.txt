0.1 Initial release

0.2 fixed some error on configuration class
    added a new query to inspect user locked as LOCKED(TIMED) and EXPIRED(GRACE)
    correct problem with database that has wrong connection parameters or connection 
    is unavailable
    added on query.props <QUERY_NAME>.NoDataFound= where you can specify a value 
    that will be used when no data are founded.

2010-03-29
0.3 fixed trouble with connection, now if a database is unavailable will be removed 
and on next loop 
  	the daemon try again to get connection.
  	Besides now all the configuration is dynamics, if you add a database this will 
    be used on next loop.
	  There is only a constraint the ZabbixDaemon.MaxThreadNumber need be >= of the 
    number of your databases.

    - SERVERNAME = server.example.com - SERVERADDRESS = 192.168.0.1
    CATALOG Oracle Database Catalog Views 10.2.0.4.0 VALID
    CATJAVA Oracle Database Java Packages 10.2.0.4.0 VALID

    DB_NAME and INSTANCE_NAME can be different just in case of RAC or DATAGUARD configuration.
    Modified how retrieve the values from resultset now is supported an output with 
    more column and more rows
    Database are removed dynamically this mean that you can add and remove database 
    without restart the daemon.
    Founded a little bug on connection to database, there was a connection that was 
    idle and never used now is fixed.

0.9.3 Added default values for:
		MaxWait
		MaxIdle
		MaxActive

		OrabbixDaemon.MaxThreadNumber (this one is calculated and based from number of monitored databases)
	New features:
	you can specify for each database different values of:
		MaxWait
		MaxIdle
		MaxActive
		
		
1.0.0
	Modified templates and divided on 3 separed files:
		one for items
		one for trigger

1.1.0
  I've modified query according to post
  http://www.zabbix.com/forum/showpost.php?p=73509&postcount=122
  and as suggestet from Brian H. resultset is protected from null values
  Thank you Brian H.

  Added a parameter 
    <QueryName>.Period=10 that introduce a period execution between two executions of the specified query 
      value are expressed in minute.If not specified any value use the default value of 5 minute
  Added parameter 
    <QueryName>.Active=[true|false] if true query is executed otherwise skipped 
  Added a queryfile to each databases spcified by 
    <DBNAME>.QueryListFile=./conf/query.props
    so each database can have his own customized parameter files.
  Added
    <QueryName>.NoDataFound default value if no data found
    <QueryName>.RaceConditionQuery  
    <QueryName>.RaceConditionValue if this value match the returned from "RaceConditionQuery" QueryName is executed otherwise skipped

1.2.0-RC1
   
    Modified as suggested from Sean, Session's graphs now "Active Session" is at the bottom of the
  stack so you can see how close you are to reaching the trigger.
   
    Improved scalability and multithreading now Orabbix can scale very easily 
    Now controls executed on databases  are independent of each other
    I removed almost completely sequential procedure on software so bottlenecks are higly reduced
    Added parameter 
    <QueryName>.Trim=[true|false] if true the resultset is trimmed (default is true)
    <QueryName>.AddSpaces=[true|false] if true the add a space between columns of resultset(default is true)
    <QueryName>.ExcludeColumnsList=[1,2,3,..n]= exclude from result set the 1st, the 2nd etc.. columns from resultset                         
 
    Now Orabbix use ojdbc6 for Oracle 11.2 
    NOTE: This is a Candidare Release 
 
 
1.2.0-RC3
   modified the extension  of all configuration files to remove collision (you will never found overwrote your own config files)
   Now is needed specify the QueryFile for each database Implemented Apache Daemon and now Orabbix can run as a service on MS 
        Windows
   NOTE:There is no more a default QueryFile
   Solved an issue about "alive" items
   Changed startup script now jar don't have more a predefined classpath but it's generated dynamically
   
1.2.1 added a new parameter in queryfile to define a default period valid for whole queries in file.
    the parameter is :
        DefaultQueryPeriod=<default period in minutes>
    still possible to define a custom period for each query with
    <QUERY_NAME>.Period=<period in minutes>
    
   
10/12/2011
1.2.2 
    Added the following parameter on main configuration file:
    DefaultUser = <USERNAME> 
    DefaultPassword = <PASSWORD>
    <DB_NAME>.ExtraQueryListFile =
    
    on query's properties file I've added the following parameter:
    <QUERY_NAME>.WhenNotAlive = <VALUE>

    with these parameter you can define a default username and password for 
    all the database. 
    DefaultUser = <USERNAME> 
    DefaultPassword = <PASSWORD>
    this default parameter can be overridden using the couple 
    <DB_NAME>.User and <DB_NAME>.User
    Is possible to override only Username or Password.
    
    the following parameter
    <DB_NAME>.ExtraQueryListFile = 
    add another custom query to a default query file.
    if there are duplicate the ExtraQueryListFile will override them.
    
    the following parameter
    <QUERY_NAME>.WhenNotAlive = <VALUE>
    is used to specify a value or a string to send if a database is not working,
    doing so you are going to "clean" the graphs generated in Zabbix with a "set" value.
    This fix the issue introduced by "Zabbix Trapper":
     - if Zabbix don't receive data the graphs don't change anymore.
